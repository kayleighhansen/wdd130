    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>My webisite has two clear goals: to build revenue and share information. I want to reach far more people about my business and increase customer traffic.</p>
    <p>I also want to share information about the service we provide to address concerns and questions that may be preventing potential customers from participating.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our main target are young families with young children. Since our activities are mainly group activities, I felt that families with younger children would be the</p>
    <p>main group of people interested in our services. Middle-aged parents are also one of the most frequent internet users and will increase business traffic.</p>
    <p>I am expecting most of our customers to access our website through their mobile devices first then with a laptop.</p>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
